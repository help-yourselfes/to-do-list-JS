- and tasks

Obviously, you can delete them too:

Of course, you can mark your tasks as completed:

If you have a lot of categories, you can collapse them by pressing on the corner:

 They will be shown in the 'collapsed categories' bar:

 A category returns to the task list when you tap on its bubble.
